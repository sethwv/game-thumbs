## Team Matching

The API uses intelligent team matching with weighted scoring:

### Priority Order:
1. **Abbreviation** (highest priority) - e.g., "LAL", "BOS"
2. **Team Nickname** - e.g., "Lakers", "Celtics"
3. **Short Display Name** - e.g., "LA Lakers"
4. **Full Display Name** - e.g., "Los Angeles Lakers"
5. **Location/City** - e.g., "Los Angeles", "Boston"
6. **Partial Matches** - Flexible matching for convenience

### Examples:
```
/nba/lakers/celtics/thumb          ‚úì Team nicknames
/nba/los%20angeles/boston/thumb    ‚úì Cities
/nba/LAL/BOS/thumb                 ‚úì Abbreviations
/nfl/chiefs/49ers/thumb            ‚úì Mixed formats
```
