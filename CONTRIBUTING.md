## Quick Contributions

### Adding Team Aliases

If a team isn't being recognized, add aliases to `teams.json`:

```json
{
  "nfl": {
    "patriots": {
      "aliases": ["pats", "new england", "ne patriots"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Fixing Team Data

Correct incorrect colors, logos, or abbreviations in `teams.json`:

```json
{
  "nba": {
    "lakers": {
      "override": {
        "color": "#552583",
        "alternateColor": "#FDB927"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding New Leagues

Add league support in `leagues.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "liga-mx": {
    "name": "Liga MX",
    "shortName": "LigaMX",
    "providerId": "espn",
    "providers": [{
      "espn": {
        "espnSport": "soccer",
        "espnSlug": "mex.1"
      }
    }]
  }
}
```
