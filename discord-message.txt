**NCAA Sports Endpoint Update**

Just pushed an update expanding NCAA sports coverage from 4 to 16 sports.

**What's New:**
Added `/ncaa/{sport}/{teamA}/{teamB}` endpoint with sport-friendly aliases instead of having to remember league codes like `ncaaf` or `ncaam`.

All NCAA sports now display proper sport-specific logos (sourced from NCAA.com) instead of generic ESPN branding.

**Endpoint Format:**
```
/ncaa/{sport}/{teamA}/{teamB}/thumb
/ncaa/{sport}/{teamA}/{teamB}/cover
/ncaa/{sport}/{teamA}/{teamB}/logo
```
