## NCAA Shorthand

The `/ncaa/:sport/:team1/:team2/:type` endpoint provides a convenient way to access NCAA sports using sport names instead of league codes.

**Format:** `/ncaa/:sport/:team1/:team2/:type`

See the [NCAA Shorthand API Reference](api-reference/ncaa-route.html) for the complete list of supported sport identifiers and aliases.

**Examples:**
```
/ncaa/football/alabama/georgia/thumb
/ncaa/march-madness/duke/unc/cover
/ncaa/womens-basketball/uconn/stanford/logo
/ncaa/ice-hockey/minnesota/wisconsin/thumb
/ncaa/softball/oklahoma/alabama/cover

## Adding New Leagues

New leagues can be added by configuring them in `leagues.json`. Each league requires:

- **shortName**: League code used in API endpoints
- **name**: Full league name for display
- **providers**: Array of provider configurations (tried in order)

### Single Provider Configuration

**ESPN Provider:**
```javascript
{
  "shortName": "nba",
  "name": "National Basketball Association",
  "providers": [
    {
      "espn": {
        "espnSport": "basketball",
        "espnSlug": "nba"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The provider type is automatically inferred from the config field (`espn` = ESPN provider).

**TheSportsDB Provider:**
```javascript
{
  "shortName": "ohl",
  "name": "Ontario Hockey League",
  "logoUrl": "./assets/OHL_LIGHTMODE.png",
  "logoUrlDark": "./assets/OHL_DARKMODE.png",
  "providers": [
    {
      "theSportsDB": {
        "leagueId": "5159",
        "leagueName": "Canadian OHL"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The provider type is automatically inferred from the config field (`theSportsDB` = TheSportsDB provider).

**FlagCDN Provider (International):**
```javascript
{
  "shortName": "olympics",
  "name": "Olympic Games",
  "logoUrl": "./assets/2026_OLYMPICS.png",
  "providers": [
    {
      "flagcdn": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

The provider type is automatically inferred from the config field (`flagcdn` = FlagCDN provider).

### Multiple Providers with Priority

Configure multiple providers for the same league. They are tried in order (top to bottom) before falling back to `fallbackLeague`:

```javascript
{
  "shortName": "ohl",
  "name": "Ontario Hockey League",
  "logoUrl": "./assets/OHL_LIGHTMODE.png",
  "logoUrlDark": "./assets/OHL_DARKMODE.png",
  "providers": [
    {
      "theSportsDB": {
        "leagueId": "5159",
        "leagueName": "Canadian OHL"
      }
    },
    {
      "espn": {
        "espnSport": "hockey",
        "espnSlug": "ohl"
      }
    }
  ],
  "fallbackLeague": "nhl"
}
```

Provider types are automatically inferred: `theSportsDB` = TheSportsDB, `espn` = ESPN.

**Resolution Order (top to bottom):**
1. Try TheSportsDB first
2. If team not found, try ESPN
3. If still not found, fall back to NHL league

### Configuration Fields

**Required:**
- `name`: Full league name for display
- `providers`: Array of provider configurations (tried in priority order)

**Optional:**
- `logoUrl`: Custom league logo URL or local path (light mode)
- `logoUrlDark`: Custom dark mode league logo URL or local path
- `aliases`: Array of alternative names for the league
- `fallbackLeague`: League code to fall back to when team not found (checked after all providers)

For more details on the technical implementation, see [Technical Details](technical-details.html).
